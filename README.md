### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?


        The weather app lab this week related to what we were doing and helped me understand how to make API calls. This week, I felt much more equipped to complete the project despite using both React and API's for the very first time. For the required features, I felt comfortable with what was going on and was able to figure things out on my own a majority of the time. I felt unprepared for the embedded movie trailer stretch feature but after reading through the API documentation, I was able to figure it out. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  

        If I had more time I would have finished the sidebar. Right now the sidebar has been created but the css isn't complete hence why I currently do not have it displayed on the site. Additionally, I would have used debouncing within the search API call so as to decrease the amount of API calls being made during search. This would increase the efficiency and optimize search in terms of API calls being made. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?


        The demo went well for the most part. I was able to answer everyone's questions in a manner that made sense to them which made me very happy. Following the presentation, I was also able to help a few of my peers implement features in a methodology similar to mine. I am aware that when I get nervous, I can start to move through things very fast. That said, I think I kept a good pace throughout the presentation. One thing I would like to improve upon is my public speaking. When I say this, I mean speaking more concisely and with fewer delays in thought. 

### Open-source libraries used


    N/A. Did not end up using any open source libraries. 

### Shout out


    Sammy once again was of great help. He helped me figure out the API calls earlier in the week. His help gave me the know-how and enabled me to then redo all of the API calls later in the week in a way that is much more efficient.
